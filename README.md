# EthiopianAgriAssist

Currently Agriculture is the backbone of Ethiopia's economy. 
Agriculture sector employs 66.63% of Ethiopian on 2021, 
and therefore contribute to 80% of exports and 40% from whole Ethiopia's GDP. 

Therefore, with huge labor forces and water resource, 
Ethiopia has marvelous opportunities for the commercialization their agriculture product. 
However, Ethiopia's current fruit, vegetable, and animal production for export are low values 
because of fragmented cultivation and lack of quality products. 

AgriAssist system is a project to optimise agriculture system in Ethiopia. 
Our team integrated the supply chain management of farming necessities, 
spreading farming information, and disease control practices 
with the goal of provide better support for the Ethiopian farmers.
